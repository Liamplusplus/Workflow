Now using workflow is very simple. Type "workflow" into the terminal for a summary of available commands.
Once you use 'initcpp' to get your first project started, you can start interacting with the generated makefile.
This file will automate most of the interaction between you and the compiler, however for any significant projects
you must fill in a couple blanks under the 'User Config' section of the makefile. You can issue 'make help' to find 
out more about interacting with make.

Happy Coding.
