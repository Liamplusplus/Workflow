Welcome to workflow,

This is a lightweight program, designed for C++ developers who want to minimise
redundant work, but still have the opportunity to learn about the details of how IDEs actually work.

The general idea of Workflow is to focus on making every project created cross-platform, in the way users can use git to pull code
on any operating system and modify and build the code for Linux or Windows.

As it is open source, users can seek out the source code, and even modify or extend it to suit them.

Here is a list of features that makes this IDE different from others:

	- Very small download size; Tiny compared to more heavy IDEs. 85kB uncompressed!
	- Customizable.
	- Does not install files to any system directories such as /usr/* on Linux or System32 on windows.
	- All files are kept under the one workflow directory, you can remove the whole IDE by deleting one folder.
	
By ignoring system directories and storing everything in workflow/ provides two benefits as follows:
	
	Keeps the users projects seperate from system programs, making it much easier to keep track of work.
	Relying on system specific environment variables like LIBRARY_PATH on linux makes the build process less cross platform.

Directory schema:

bin: Binaries, a script is provided to put this in the PATH variables so programs may be executed from anywhere in a shell.

config: All configuration files made by the user in one place. It's useful to have a back up of edited config files in case something goes wrong
	or the user is on a new system.

fonts: Self explanatory

graphics: Resource directory

include: Workflow will make sure your system searches this path for headers so there is no need to explicitly tell make

licenses: Software licenses that workflow can fetch for any project a user may start.

projects: Where one should start (and hopefully finish) all their projects.

scripts: Scripts! Can be executed from any terminal :)
    
sounds: Audio files
