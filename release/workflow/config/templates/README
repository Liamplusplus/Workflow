This is a standard workflow project. This software was designed as a component to a Minimalist Development Environment.

Workflow provides a cross-platform abstraction for the tedious, repetitive parts of programming; compilers, project organisation,
target CPUs etcetera.

To get started, open up the makefile in your favourite text editor and pay attention to just the 'User Config' section. This is where
you enter the basic information about your project.

	MAIN := [The name of your project]
	BRANCHES := [Each branch made with the branch script should be here in a space-seperated list]
	LIBRARIES := [Space seperated list of used libraries. Makefile will search $WORKFLOW_LIB for this directory if on a Linux machine]
	LIBFILES := [Space seperated list of library files used in linking. Example: -lomega to link to shared libomega.[so/dll] or static libomega.a]

That is about all on compiling projects using the generated makefile, aliases have also been provided for easier make interaction, happy programming.
